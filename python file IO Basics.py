########### Python File IO Basics #########

# Two types of memory
# 1. Volatile Memory : Data cleared as System Shut Down
# Example : RAM
# 2. Non-Volatile Memory : Data remains saved always.
# Example : Hard Disk

# File : In Non-Volatile Memory we store Data as File
# File may be text file,binary file(Ex - Image,mp3),etc.

# Different Modes of Opening files in Python

"""
"r" - Open file for reading - Default mode
"w" - Open a file for writing
"x" - Create file if not exists
"a" - Add more content to a file/ append at end in file
"t" - open file in text mode - Default mode
"b" - open file in binary mode
"+" - for update (read and write both)
